                Here we will keep you updated on our events, community work and the role that we will be playing 
                in Coventry's City of Culture 2021.
                <p>Due to the unforseen pandemic that is Covid 19 we have been unable to hold our
                    3 annual Family Fun Day's but it will be back next year! In the mean time we
                    we wound encourage you to tune into the big tunes that would have played at
                     the Family Fun Days over at the Arawak Radio Station.

            <div class="Heading"><h2>ABOUT</h2></div>
            <div class="Heading"><h3>Who we are</h3></div>
            <p>Sherril Donaldson, Mikey Lee aka DJ Mikey D and Clive Tennant</p>
            <div class="content-text"><p> ACT was formed in early 2017, by Michael Lee, 
                Sherril Donaldson & Clive Tennant, as a means of consolidating two other 
                community enterprises operated by one or more of the named individuals.  
                The creation of ACT was a step to ensure the sustainability of the both 
                enterprises and the creation of other services for our community.</p>
               
                <p>The first of the two enterprises was The Family Sports Fun Day.
                    First started in 2011, with just over 100 people in attendance, 
                    this event was started because of the need to bring our Caribbean 
                    families together and also to fill a gap created by the demise of 
                    the funded “Caribbean Carnival".</p>

                <p>Since its inception The Family Sports Fun Day has enjoyed the gradual 
                    increase of participation culminating last year, 2018, with a record 
                    attendance of over 1000 people turning up to each of the events.</p>
                    
                <p>The events are scheduled to take place on the 1st Sunday in June, 
                    July and  August at The Xcel Leisure Centre, Canley, Coventry. </p>

                <p>The second enterprise, The ArawaK Radio Station, started in March 2015 
                    at the Broad Street Young People’s Centre, Foleshill, Coventry. 
                    It was started because of a lack of diversity in radio broadcasting 
                    for the Jamaican & Caribbean community in the city of Coventry. 
                    It was also an opportunity for young people with Caribbean heritage 
                    to enhance their desires to learn about radio broadcasting, sound 
                    engineering and to host radio shows with the music they do not hear, 
                    as the norm, on mainstream radio.</p>
                    
                    <p>The station is run entirely by volunteers and currently there are over 
                    30 presenters offering a 24/7 services to our listeners.  The radio also 
                    offers and allows local BME businesses to advertise their products, services
                     and events to a very specific, largely BME, audience.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through the development of ACT in 2019 there will be significant growth for 
                    both the Family Fun Day and the radio.
