## instructions

Use `control + k, control + v` to get a markdown preview of these notes in vscode

```

## Suggestions

- use lowercase hyphenated names e.g. `css/arawak-community-trust.css` becomes `arawak-community-trust.css`
  **reasons**:
  - when the site is live on a linux server it will not allow files with spaces in the filenames
  - lowercase names is just a convention

- install in VScode
  - Code Spell Checker - to help with keeping naming consistent
  - Prettier - to help with formatting
